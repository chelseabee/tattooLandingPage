# tattooLandingPage
I designed this webpage for a tattoo artist, with the goal of representing his work to clients, and creating a way to contact him. 
This is the first full front end project that I have completed and my first real dive into bootstrap. Overall I am so happy with the way that it turned out. 
I really enjoyed working with the Bootstrap grid/ flex properties, it made it so easy to make everything line up and the responsive. 

The page features 5 sections:

- A Hero Section

- A Portfolio Section

There are defintely a couple bugs that I hope to work out as my skills grow. I am having trouble with the JS compiling, and I dont know if it has to do with the code itself or that the HTML file isnt properly calling the JS file? I utilized a lightbox carousel tutorial that I found on the web since I am still very new to JS, and so I am sure that this is some novice error, but I'll keep trying to figure that out. I also know that I need to work on my knowledge of accessibility, the site in its current state is not too friendly for those with screen readers etc.
